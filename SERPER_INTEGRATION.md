# Serper API Integration

## Overview
Atlas Escape now integrates with Serper API to fetch **real, accurate places from Google** when generating itineraries!

## What is Serper?
Serper is a Google Search API that provides real-time search results from Google. We use it to fetch:
- üçΩÔ∏è Real restaurants with reviews and locations
- üè® Actual hotels with ratings and prices
- üéØ Verified tourist attractions and activities

## How It Works

### 1. Dual API Architecture
When you generate an itinerary:

```
User Input ‚Üí [Serper API] ‚Üí Real Google Data
                    ‚Üì
           [OpenAI ChatGPT] ‚Üí Structured Itinerary
                    ‚Üì
              Final Result (with real places!)
```

### 2. API Key Configuration
Both APIs work together:
- **OpenAI API**: Required - generates the itinerary structure
- **Serper API**: Optional but recommended - provides real place data

### 3. Smart Fallback
- ‚úÖ **With Serper**: Uses real restaurants, hotels, and attractions from Google
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Without Serper**: Uses AI-generated recommendations (still good, but generic)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Configure OpenAI (Required)
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key
3. In Atlas Escape, click "Configure API Key"
4. Enter your OpenAI key

## API Details

### Serper API Endpoints Used
- **Google Search**: Finds places by query
- **Parameters**:
  - `q`: Search query (e.g., "best restaurants in Paris")
  - `num`: Number of results (10-20)
  - `gl`: Location/country code

### Search Queries Generated
For each destination, we search:
1. `best restaurants in [destination]`
2. `[budget-level] hotels in [destination] with good reviews`
3. `top tourist attractions in [destination]`
4. `best [preference] attractions in [destination]` (for each preference)

## Security
- ‚úÖ API keys stored **locally** in your browser
- ‚úÖ Never sent to our servers
- ‚úÖ Encrypted localStorage
- ‚úÖ Keys can be removed anytime

## Troubleshooting

### "Serper API error"
- Check your API key is correct
- Verify you have searches remaining
- Check your internet connection

### No real places showing
- Make sure Serper key is configured
- Check browser console for errors
- Serper may not have data for very small/remote destinations

### Still works without Serper?
- Yes! OpenAI generates itineraries without Serper
- Serper just makes them more accurate and uses real places
