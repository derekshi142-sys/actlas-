# API Keys Cloud Sync ☁️

## Overview
Your API keys are now automatically saved to your Firebase account and synced across all your devices!

## What Changed

### Before
- API keys were stored only in browser localStorage
- Keys were lost when clearing browser data
- Had to re-enter keys on different browsers/devices

### After ✅
- API keys are automatically saved to Firebase Firestore
- Keys sync across all your devices
- Login from any browser and your keys are there
- Still stored locally for fast access
- Secure cloud backup

## How It Works

### 1. **Automatic Sync on Save**
When you save API keys in the API Keys modal:
- Keys are saved to localStorage (for fast access)
- Keys are automatically synced to Firestore (cloud storage)
- Associated with your user account

### 2. **Automatic Load on Login**
When you log in:
- System checks Firestore for saved API keys
- Automatically loads keys to localStorage
- Initializes all API services with your keys
- Works seamlessly across devices

### 3. **Real-time Updates**
- Keys update immediately across services
- No manual refresh needed
- Consistent state between local and cloud storage

## Supported API Keys

All three API keys are synced:
- ✅ **OpenAI** - For AI itinerary generation
- ✅ **Serper** - For Google search data
- ✅ **HotelBeds** - For hotel availability (Key + Secret)

## Security

### Data Storage
- Keys are stored in Firestore under collection `userApiKeys`
- Each user has their own document (userId)
- Keys are associated with Firebase Authentication

### Access Control
- Only authenticated users can save/load keys
- Firestore security rules should restrict access to user's own keys
- Keys are never logged or exposed in client code

### Best Practices
1. Use environment-specific API keys
2. Regularly rotate your API keys
3. Monitor API key usage in your provider dashboards
4. Keep Firebase authentication secure

## Implementation Details

### New Files
- `lib/apiKeysService.ts` - Firestore sync functions

### Updated Files
- `lib/openai.ts` - Added Firestore sync
- `lib/serper.ts` - Added Firestore sync
- `lib/hotelbeds.ts` - Added Firestore sync
- `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Load keys on login
- `components/ApiKeyModal.tsx` - Async save/remove functions

### Key Functions

#### Save Keys
```typescript
// Automatically saves to both localStorage and Firestore
await saveApiKey(apiKey)
await saveSerperKey(serperKey)
await saveHotelBedsCredentials(key, secret)
```

#### Load Keys (Automatic)
```typescript
// Called automatically on login in AuthContext
const apiKeys = await loadApiKeysFromFirestore(userId)
```

#### Remove Keys
```typescript
// Removes from both localStorage and Firestore
await removeApiKey()
await removeSerperKey()
await removeHotelBedsCredentials()
```

## Firestore Data Structure

```
userApiKeys (collection)
  └── {userId} (document)
      ├── openai: "sk-proj-..."
      ├── serper: "858a4fe..."
      ├── hotelbedsKey: "..."
      └── hotelbedsSecret: "..."
```

## Testing

### Test the Feature
1. **Login** to your account
2. **Add API keys** via the API Keys modal
3. **Logout**
4. **Clear browser data** (localStorage)
5. **Login again** from same or different browser
6. **Verify** keys are automatically loaded

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Keys persist after logout
- ✅ Keys available on different browsers
- ✅ Keys available on different devices
- ✅ No need to re-enter keys

## Troubleshooting

### Keys Not Syncing
1. Check Firebase configuration is correct
2. Verify user is logged in (check console)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Firestore is initialized

### Keys Not Loading
1. Check Firestore rules allow read access
2. Verify keys exist in Firestore database
3. Check console for error messages
4. Try logging out and back in

### Console Messages
- ✅ `"API keys loaded from Firestore and synced to localStorage"` - Success
- ✅ `"API keys saved to Firestore"` - Save successful
- ⚠️ `"Firestore not configured"` - Firebase not initialized
- ❌ `"Error loading API keys from Firestore"` - Check Firestore rules

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Encrypt keys before storing in Firestore
- [ ] Add key validation before saving
- [ ] Support multiple key sets per user
- [ ] Add key expiration tracking
- [ ] Implement key sharing for team accounts
- [ ] Add audit log for key changes

## Migration

### For Existing Users
Existing users with keys in localStorage:
1. Keys remain in localStorage
2. On next save, keys sync to Firestore
3. No action needed from users
4. Seamless transition

### For New Users
New users:
1. Create account
2. Add API keys
3. Keys automatically sync
4. Ready to use on any device
