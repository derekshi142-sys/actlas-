# API Keys Cloud Sync - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Your vacation planning app now saves API keys to user accounts! Users can login from any browser or device and their API keys will automatically be available.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Users had to re-enter their OpenAI, Serper, and HotelBeds API keys every time they:
- Used a different browser
- Cleared browser data
- Used a different device
- Used incognito mode

**After:** API keys are saved to their Firebase account and automatically sync across all devices and browsers.

## 📁 Files Created

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. `lib/openai.ts`
- Added Firestore sync to `saveApiKey()`
- Added Firestore sync to `removeApiKey()`
- Added `setOpenAIUserId()` for user tracking
- Added `loadApiKeyFromFirestore()` for automatic loading
- Made save/remove functions async

### 2. `lib/serper.ts`
- Added Firestore sync to `saveSerperKey()`
- Added Firestore sync to `removeSerperKey()`
- Added `setSerperUserId()` for user tracking
- Added `loadSerperKeyFromFirestore()` for automatic loading
- Made save/remove functions async

### 3. `lib/hotelbeds.ts`
- Added Firestore sync to `saveHotelBedsCredentials()`
- Added Firestore sync to `removeHotelBedsCredentials()`
- Added `setHotelBedsUserId()` for user tracking
- Added `loadHotelBedsCredentialsFromFirestore()` for automatic loading
- Made save/remove functions async

### 4. `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added automatic API key loading on user login
- Sets user ID for all API key services
- Loads keys from Firestore and syncs to localStorage
- Clears user ID on logout
- Logs success/error messages to console

### 5. `components/ApiKeyModal.tsx`
- Updated `handleSave()` to be async and await saves
- Updated `handleRemoveOpenAI()` to be async
- Updated `handleRemoveSerper()` to be async
- Updated `handleRemoveHotelBeds()` to be async
- Updated UI text to reflect cloud sync
- Changed messaging from "stored locally" to "synced across devices"

## 🔄 How It Works

### When User Saves API Keys:
```
1. User enters keys in ApiKeyModal
2. User clicks "Save Keys"
3. Keys saved to localStorage (fast local access)
4. Keys automatically synced to Firestore (cloud backup)
5. Associated with user's Firebase Auth UID
```

### When User Logs In:
```
1. User authenticates with Firebase
2. AuthContext detects login
3. Sets user ID for all API services
4. Loads keys from Firestore
5. Syncs keys to localStorage
6. Initializes all API services
7. User can immediately start planning trips
```

### When User Logs Out:
```
1. User clicks logout
2. AuthContext clears user ID from services
3. Keys remain in localStorage (for convenience)
4. Next login will refresh from Firestore
```

## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Data Storage
- Keys stored in Firestore collection: `userApiKeys`
- Each user has one document with their userId
- Structure: `userApiKeys/{userId}` → { openai, serper, hotelbedsKey, hotelbedsSecret }

### Access Control
- User must be authenticated (Firebase Auth)
- User can only access their own document
- No cross-user access allowed
- No anonymous access allowed

### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
match /userApiKeys/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Firestore Security Rules
```bash
# Option A: Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database → Rules
3. Copy contents from firestore.rules
4. Paste and publish

# Option B: Firebase CLI
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. Test the Feature
```bash
# Your dev server should already be running
# If not: npm run dev

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Login to an account
3. Click API Keys modal
4. Add some test keys
5. Logout
6. Clear browser localStorage (DevTools → Application → Storage)
7. Login again
8. Keys should automatically load
```

### 3. Verify in Firebase Console
```bash
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Click Firestore Database
3. Look for "userApiKeys" collection
4. Should see documents with user IDs
5. Each document contains their API keys
```

## 📊 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Deploy Firestore security rules
- [ ] Login and add API keys
- [ ] Verify keys saved in Firestore (check console)
- [ ] Logout and clear localStorage
- [ ] Login again - keys should auto-load
- [ ] Try on different browser - keys should be there
- [ ] Test remove key functionality
- [ ] Verify keys removed from Firestore
- [ ] Test without internet (should use localStorage)
- [ ] Check console logs for errors

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Console Messages to Look For

**Success Messages:**
- ✅ `"API keys saved to Firestore"`
- ✅ `"API keys loaded from Firestore and synced to localStorage"`
- ✅ `"API key 'openai' removed from Firestore"`

**Warning Messages:**
- ⚠️ `"Firestore not configured - API keys will only be stored locally"`
- ⚠️ `"No API keys found in Firestore for this user"`

**Error Messages:**
- ❌ `"Error saving API keys to Firestore: [details]"`
- ❌ `"Error loading API keys from Firestore: [details]"`
- ❌ `"Failed to sync [service] key to Firestore: [details]"`

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- [ ] API key encryption before storing
- [ ] Key rotation reminders
- [ ] Usage tracking per API key
- [ ] Team/organization key sharing
- [ ] API key expiration dates
- [ ] Multiple key sets (dev/prod)
- [ ] Key validation before saving
- [ ] Audit log of key changes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Keys Not Syncing
- Check Firebase configuration is correct
- Verify Firestore is initialized (check console)
- Check user is logged in
- Review Firestore security rules

### Keys Not Loading
- Check security rules are deployed
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check console for error messages
- Try logout/login again

### Permission Denied Errors
- Deploy the Firestore security rules
- Verify rules allow user access to own data
- Check userId matches in Firestore document
